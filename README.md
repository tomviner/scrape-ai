# AI info scraper

## API Data

A [git scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) that records OpenAI API data. See [openai/api](openai/api). Currently just my model list.

## ChatGPT Code Interpreter

This data has to be compiled via ChatGPT Code Interpreter sessions.
I'm including prompts and code that I've used. Although it will often rewrite the
code as it sees fit, before running it.

See [openai/code-interpreter/](openai/code-interpreter/)
